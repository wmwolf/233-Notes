\section{Introduction}
\emph{Monday, January 6, 2013}\\

\n This course is called ``Interstellar Medium'' (ISM), but really it is about
the more general topic of the physics of diffuse gas in the universe. By
diffuse, we mean \emph{really} diffuse, down to number densities of 1
cm$^{-3}$, much more diffuse than the best vacuums in terrestrial laboratories.
This includes the interstellar gas in galaxies as well as the intergalactic gas
in between the galaxies.

\subsection{Organization of the ISM in the Milky Way} % (fold)
\label{sub:a_first_look}
Interstellar gas is what forms the stars in galaxies that are the dominant
sources of energy and light in the universe. Thus, understanding the physics of
the ISM helps us understand (and predict) the visible appearance of galaxies.\\

\noindent The space between the stars is occupied by gas, dust, cosmic rays,
electromagnetic radiation (from stars, the CMB, and radition from interstellar
matter), neutrinos, dark matter particles (whatever they are), and magnetic and
gravitational fields. Do note that dust is distinct from gas, as dust grains
have a lengthscale (micron) four orders of magnitude greater than gas particles
(angstrom).\\

\noindent In the Milky Way, there is roughly $10^{11}\ M_\odot$ in various
components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $5\times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$ of stars
  \item $5\times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$ of dark matter
  \item $7\times 10^{9}\ M_\odot$ of interstellar gas
\end{itemize}
So the Milky Way is a rather gas-poor galaxy. Other galaxies like the
Magellanic clouds have most of their baryons in the gas phase. The obscuration
in the central disk of the Milky Way is produced by the dust along the midplane
(see color plate in 1.2, 1.65, 2.2 $\mu$m images). While the stars do form in a
very thin disk (thin compared to its width), the starlight heats up dust and
expands the dust disk to higher altitudes from the midplane.\\

\n The magnetic fields in the Milky Way can be detected by looking for
synchrotron emission (caused by electrons spiraling around galactic field
lines). We do observe this emission (see additional plate) and believe the
magnetic fields are caused by a dynamo effect due to the circulating galactic
material.

\subsubsection{Gas Content} % (fold)
\label{ssub:gas_content}
There is about $5\times 10^9\ M_\odot$ of hydrogen in the Milky Way, in the
following states
\begin{itemize}
  \item $2.9\times 10^9\ M_\odot$ of \HI gas (neutral)
  \item $1.12\times 10^9\ M_\odot$ of \HII gas (ionized)
  \item $0.84\times 10^9\ M_\odot$ of \Htwo gas (molecular)
\end{itemize}
We can track the presence of interstellar gas by looking at C$^+$ emission in
the Milky Way, which tracks hydrogen presence very well, though the weighting
is different since the emission strength is proportional to the density
squared.\\

\n Finally, we track galactic gas via CO emission, which is very concentrated
to the disk, but also has strong filaments outside the central disk of the
galaxy.\\

\n The interestellar medium exhibits turbulence that is the reult of supernovae
and other violent hydrodynamic events.

\paragraph{Phases of Interstellar Gas} % (fold)
\label{ssub:phases_of_interstellar_gas}
We categorize the ISM into various phases according to the ionization/molecular
state of its hydrogen (descriptions taken from Draine 1.1):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Warm HI}: Neutral hydrogen gas at temperatures around $T \approx 10^{3.7}\ \mathrm{K}$. Typically at densities of $n_{\mathrm{H}}\approx 0.6\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Occupies about 40\% of the galactic disk. Often referred to as the warm neutral medium (WNM)
    \item \textbf{Cool HI}: Neutral hydrogen gas at temperatures around $T \approx 100$ K with higher densities of $n_{\mathrm{H}}\approx 30\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Occupies around 1\% of the local ISM, sometimes referred to as the cold neutral medium (CNM)
    \item \textbf{Diffuse H}$_{2}$: Like the CNM, but with larger densities and column densities, allowing molecular hydrogen (\Htwo) to be more abundant.
    \item \textbf{Dense H}$_{2}$: Gravitationally bound clouds with number densities exceeding $10^3\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Distinguished by their dark appearance (strong optical extinction) in their central regions. Hosts of star formation. Not ``dense'' by terrestrial standards.
    \item \textbf{Ionized HII} at $10^4$ K: Gas consisting largely of photoionized hydrogen, likely from ultraviolet radiation from a nearby massive star. May be dense material from a cloud (\HII region) or diffuse intercloud material (diffuse \HII). Lifetimes typically on the order of that of a massive star (Myrs). Extended diffuse photoionized regions, sometimes called the warm ionized medium (WIM), contain \emph{much} more total mass than the more visible \HII regions. Planetary nebulae (PNe) are also in this class.
    \item \textbf{Coronal Gas} (Ionized \HII at $\log T > 5.5$): Very hot, ionized gas that has been shock-heated by blastwaves from supernova explosions. It is mostly collisionally ionized with some exotic ionization states present. Typically very low density, filling about half the volume of the galactic disk. Cools on Myr timescales. Often referred to as the hot ionized medium (HIM).
  \end{itemize}
% paragraph phases_of_interstellar_gas (end)
\paragraph{Elemental Composition} % (fold)
\label{par:elemental_composition}
The gas is largely made of hydrogen and helium from the early universe, but an
additional 1-2\% (by mass) is heavy elements ($Z>2$), or to astronomers,
``metals''. The metallicity is actually a declining function from the center of
the galaxy outwards since it is the result of stellar processing, and the
center of the galaxy is more evolved then its relatively young outer regions.
The metallicity near the solar system is about half of that at the galactic
center. We know the local composition of the ISM by measuring solar
photospheric abundances and the composition of meteorites (See table 1.4 in
Draine).
% paragraph elemental_composition (end)

\subsubsection{Energy Content} % (fold)
\label{ssub:energy_content}
Energy in the CMB has a strange equipartition where nearly all components are
near 1 eV cm$^{-3}$. Some of this is self-sustaining, but since the CMB energy
density increases as $(1+z)^4$, its equality is coincidental. The rough energy
densities by categories are given in Table~\ref{tab:1.1}. Since the galactic
magnetic fields are driven by bulk motions, it is unsurprising that the
turbulent (bulk) and magnetic energies are nearly equal. If the cosmic ray
energy density were significantly greater, the magnetic fields could not
confine them, so they would simply escape the galaxy. Similarly, if the energy
from starlight were significantly higher, the ISM would expand and likely
dampen star formation, causing the near equipartion that we observe.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    Energy Type & Density (eV $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$)\\
    \hline
    Thermal & 0.49\\
    Bulk Kinetic & 0.22\\
    Cosmic Ray & 1.39\\
    Magnetic & 0.89\\
    CMB & 0.265\\
    Far infrared from dust & 0.31 \\
    Starlight & 0.54
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Energy densities in the ISM.}
  \label{tab:1.1}
\end{table}
If any of these components grows much larger than the gravitational binding
energy, then hydrostatic equilibrium is disrupted, driving a wind. All galaxies
drive winds at some time.
% subsubsection energy_content (end)
\subsubsection{Galactic Endgame} % (fold)
\label{ssub:galactic_endgame}
All of the ISM constituents are present between galaxies, and the same physical
processes apply to studying the intergalactic medium (IGM). In our present
state of the field, we can't account for the relative overabundance of dark
matter in the vicinity of a galaxy. It is thought that the ``missing baryons''
are in the circum-galactic material (CGM). The only place where the mass is
``right'' is in massive clusters. What is unknown is what sort of lengthscale
determines how far out this CGM might extend. Interestingly, the material
observed in the CGM contains metals, so either galactic winds are responsible
for pushing material processed by stellar evolution out of the galaxy, or very
massive population III stars formed at $z\sim 20-40$ to form the first metals.

% subsection a_first_look (end)
\subsection{Basics of Diffuse Gas} % (fold)
\label{sub:basics_of_diffuse_gas}
Perhaps the prettiest regions of diffuse gas are the HII regions, like the
Orion Nebula, which is illuminated by four central stars (the trapezium). The
typical HII region has a number density around $1\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and a
temperature of $10^4$\ K. A big difference between these HII regions (and in
fact most instances of interstellar gas) and stellar interiors is that they are
\emph{not} in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\\

\n The NLTE-ness of diffuse gas iss due tot he much, much lower collision rate
than in planetary atmospheres or stellar interiors. In order to achieve LTE, a
gas must satisfy the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Population of excited states given by Boltzmann equilibrium
  \item Particle energies distributed according to the Maxwell distribution
  \item Ionization balance given by Saha Equation
  \item Photon energies described by Planck Function
\end{itemize}
In diffuse gas, we may indeed be able to identify a kinetic temperature that
gives the average kinetic energy of the particles, but this temperature need
not be the same as the Boltzmann temperature, which gives the occupation of
energy states in the system. Likewise, the ionization temperature, Planck
temperature (of a blackbody), and other such derived temperatures need not
match such a diffuse system.

\section{Collisionally Excited Lines} % (fold)
\label{sec:collisionally_excited_lines}
\n\textit{Wednesday, January 8, 2014}\\

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l l}
  Environment & Number Density (cm$^{-3}$) & Collision Timescale (s)\\
  \hline
  Earth Atmosphere & $2\times 10^{13}$ & $\sim 10^{-9}$\\
  Molecular Cloud & $10^6$ & $10^8$ (several days)\\
  ISM & 1 & $10^{11}$ ($10^4$ yr)
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Some characteristic collision timescales.}
  \label{tab:2.1}
\end{table}
A typical timescale for collisions between particles can be estimated via
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coll:1} \tau = \frac{1}{\sigma v n}
\end{equation}
That is, it's essentially the inverse of the expected collision rate. Here
$\sigma$ is the cross section for interaction, $v$ is the relative velocity of
particles, and $n$ is the number density of particles. Some typical timescale
for various environments are given in Table~\ref{tab:2.1}.\\

\n Also of importance is the volumetric rate of emission or photons due to
recombination, which will be proportional to the product of electron and ion
number densities, or $r_{\mathrm{emis}}\propto n_{\mathrm{ion}}n_e$. We define
the \textbf{Emission Measure} as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:coll:2} \mathrm{EM} = \int n_e^2 ds
\end{equation}
where the integral is over some path in space. The ``natural'' units for this
measure is then pc cm$^{-6}$.
\paragraph{Example: Emission Measure of a Nova Shell} % (fold)
\label{par:example_emission_measure_of_a_nova_shell}
  For a nova shell with mass $\Delta M = 10^{-4}\ M_\odot$ expanding with a
  velocity $v=10^3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, we get an approximate emission
  measure of
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{EM} = (3\times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{pc})(10^7\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}) \sim
    3\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{pc\ cm^{-6}}
  \end{equation}
  So at early times nova shells are very bright. We could play this game with
  other objects like planetary nebulae (PNe), HII Regions, Diffuse warm-ionized
  gas, or circumgalactic gas to get an idea of how bright these objects would
  appear.
% paragraph example_emission_measure_of_a_nova_shell (end)
\subsection{Principle of Detailed Balance} % (fold)
\label{sub:detailed_bal}
  % TODO Add energy level diagram
  If we consider an atom that has only two states, 1 and 2, with degeneracies
  $g_1$ and $g_2$ with an energy gap $\epsilon_{12}$, the collisional cross
  section is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:3} \sigma_{12}(E) = \frac{h^2}{8\pi m_e
    E}\frac{\Omega_{12}(E)}{g_1}
  \end{equation}
  where $\Omega$ is the \textbf{collision strength}, which is a dimensionless
  quantity with values around order unity. The \textbf{Principle of Detailed
  Balance}, which we have not yet proven, tells us that
  $\Omega_{12}=\Omega_{21}$.\\
  
  \n Indeed, the principle of detailed balance tells us that the rate of upwards and downward collisional transitions are equal, or
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:coll:4}R_{12} &= R_{21}\\
    \label{eq:coll:5}n_1 n_e \alpha_{12} &= n_2 n_e \alpha_{21}
  \end{align}
  where $\alpha$ is the collisional excitation coefficient for that reaction. To derive this principle, we turn to statistical mechanics, and the concept of a \textbf{partition function}, which is the normalization to a boltzmann distribution:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:6} Z(T) \equiv \sum_s e^{-E(s)/(kT)}
  \end{equation}
  % TODO fix this mess
  where the sum is over all microstates. In a diulte gas, the partition function is actually a product of the particion functions from the internal system and that of the translational system:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:7} Z(T) = Z_{\mathrm{trans}}(T) \times Z_{\mathrm{int}}(T)
  \end{equation}
  Then we can define the particion function per unit volume in the usual way
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:coll:8} f(T) &= \frac{Z(T)}{V}\\
    \label{eq:coll:9} &= \left(\frac{2\pi M_x kT}{h^3}\right)^{3/2}\times Z_{\mathrm{int}}(T)
  \end{align}
  Where we've glossed over some details present in Draine (Chapter 3). Using statistical mechanics, we are more or less assuming we are in LTE, so the number densities of various states for the reaction
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:10} A + B \rightleftharpoons C
  \end{equation}
  is given in the usual way:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:11} \frac{n_{\mathrm{LTE}}(C)}{n_{\mathrm{LTE}}(A)
    n_{\mathrm{LTE}}(B)} = \frac{f(C)}{f(A)f(B)}
  \end{equation}
  which constrains the rate coefficients in a specific way. 
  % TODO something about how we don't need LTE
  Armed with this tool, we can actually try to compute collisional excitation rates:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:coll:12} R_{12} &= n_1 n_e \int_{E_{\mathrm{12}}}^\infty \sigma(v)v\,f(v)\,dv\\
    \label{eq:coll:13} R_{21} &= n_2 n_e \int_0^\infty \sigma(v)v\,f(v)\,dv
  \end{align}
  Now using the principle of detailed balance, we equate these rates and get 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:14} n_1e^{-E_{12}/(kT)}\frac{\Omega_{12}}{g_1} = \frac{n_2 \Omega_{21}}{g_2}
  \end{equation}
  Solving for the ratio of the number densities, we get
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:15} \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\alpha_{12}}{\alpha_{21}} = \frac{\Omega_{21}}{g_1}\frac{g_2}{\Omega_{12}} e^{-E_{12}/(kT)}
  \end{equation}
  Or, more simply
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coll:16} \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\Omega_{21}}{\Omega_{12}} \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-E_{12}/(kT)}
  \end{equation}
  Now if we are in LTE, we immediately recover $\Omega_{21} = \Omega_{12}$ since the Boltzmann ratio is already present. However, the collision strength is an intrinsic property of the ion, so this must be true in all cases. That is, we dont' require LTE to recover $\Omega_{12}=\Omega_{21}$ simply because we proved that it \emph{does} apply in LTE, and thus at all times.
  
% subsection detailed_bal (end)
\subsection{Einstein Relations} % (fold)
\label{sub:einstein_relations}
In the low density limit, spontaneous decay dominates emission since collisionally excited transitions are few and far between. Then the transition rate can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:1} n_en_1\alpha_{12} = n_2 A_{21}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the \textbf{Einstein Coefficient} for spontaneous decay from state 2 to state 1. 
% TODO explain this next equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:2} F_{12} = E_{12} A_{21} n_2
\end{equation}
% subsection einstein_relations (end)
Subbing in some Boltzmann algebra, $n_2$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:3} n_2 = \frac{n_en_1}{A_{21}} \left( \frac{2\pi \hbar^4} {k m_e^3}\right)^{1/2} \frac{\Omega_{12}}{g_1} \frac{e^{-E_12}/(kT)}{\sqrt{T}}
\end{equation}
Plugging \eqref{eq:einstein:3} into \eqref{eq:einstein:2} and evaluating some of the constatns, we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:4} F_{12} = E_{21} n_e n_1 \left(8.62942\times 10^{-6}\right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} \frac{\Omega_{12}}{g_1}e^{-E_{12}/(kT)}
\end{equation}
Now in the high density limit, we do something similar, getting
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:5} n_e n_1 \alpha_{12} = n_2 A_{21} + n_e n_2 \alpha{21}
\end{equation}
Now we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:6} F_{12} = E_{21} A_{21} n_1 \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-E_{12} / (kT)}
\end{equation}
These two regimes beg for us to define a critical density that separates these two limits where $n_2A_{21} = n_2n_e \alpha_{21}$, which is, after some algebra,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:7} \boxed{n_{e, \mathrm{crit}} = \frac{A_{21}g_2 T^{1/2}} {\beta \Omega_{12}}}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein:8} \beta \equiv \left[\frac{2\pi \hbar^4}{k m_e^3}\right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}
For forbidden lines, this critical density is in the range of $10^2-10^7\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. For intercombination lines, the critical density is around $10^10\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. For resonance lines (aka permitted lines), the critical density is $10^{15}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$
